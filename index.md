## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorm

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I enjoyed the demand forecasting aspect of my domain this quarter. I think it was interesting to learn to consider business context when developping the model. I think the process really shows how domain knowledge is able to improve the accuracy of statistical models.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

The work done in Q1 so far is about finding the perfect number of staff for one specific forecast like 100 incoming calls. For Q2, I'd like to build a model that plans for a range of forecasts instead of just one. For example, it would find the best staffing plan to handle "somewhere between 80 and 120 calls." This would give us a safer plan since the demand is time-varying and there are a lot of uncertainties.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

We are currently using an open sourced dataset to practice and get an understanding of the type of data we are working with, and it's somewhat limiting due to not having that many row. Moving forward in Quarter 2, I hope we would be able to use a more extensive dataset that's specific to Intuit so that we can better capture the patterns and create something that's helpful to the company.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

We're in the process of using scipy for supply planning, and later on it would be cool to try Gurobi, a resource mentioned by our mentors to see if it can find the best headcount faster, especially if our dataset gets bigger.
